# List 1: 7  List 2: 11(social network)

## Description
This project implements a **social network model** using **graph data structures** based on **adjacency lists**.  
It provides functionality for managing users (vertices), relationships (edges), and analyzing network connections through classical graph algorithms.

## Implemented Functionality
- Graphs based on **adjacency lists**
- Adding and removing **vertices** and **edges**
- Checking **graph connectivity**
- Determining the **distance between two vertices**
- Implemented algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (**BFS**)
  - **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** (shortest path)
  - Algorithm for finding **central users**
  - Algorithm for detecting **cycles**
-  Modular mechanism for adding new algorithms
-  Graph **visualization** (export to `.dot` format)
-  **Random data generation** (users and connections)
-  **Error handling** and testing of invalid inputs
-  **Unit tests** for verifying core functionality
-  Saving and loading graph data to `.txt`

Seven * were implemented.
